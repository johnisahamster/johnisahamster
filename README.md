# Hi, my name is John Howe.



## About Me
I'm a second-year Software Engineering student at [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca).
My coding interests are physics simulations, image editing, and UI design, although many of my projects involve web development and .NET apps.
I also plan on working on making Minecraft mods in the near future.

I've made this github account to store my past projects and future personal/professional projects, 
so any of my current school project repositories are worked on using my [school account](https://github.com/johnh-otu).

## Skills
I have experience working with Java, C++, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, Nodejs, PHP, MySQL and more, but C# and Java are probably my favourite languages to work with.
My most valuable programming skills are being able to adapt to new environments and being able to read documentation. :)
