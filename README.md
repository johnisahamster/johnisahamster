# Hi, my name is John Howe.



## About Me
I'm an IT Solutions Analyst currently working with the [Toronto Transit Commission](https://www.ttc.ca/).
I have a Bachelor's in Software Engineering from [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca).
My coding interests are physics simulations, image editing, and UI design, although many of my projects involve web development and .NET apps.
I also plan on working on making Minecraft mods in the near future.

I've made this github account to store my personal projects, 
so any of my school project repositories were worked on using my [school account](https://github.com/johnh-otu). I don't currently use GitHub for my professional work.

## Skills
I have experience working with Java, C++, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, Nodejs, PHP, MySQL and more, but C# and Java are probably my favourite languages to work with.
Because of work, I have recently been forced to learn Angular, which I'm currently having fun messing around with.

Of course, my most valuable programming skills are being able to adapt to new environments and being able to read documentation. :)
